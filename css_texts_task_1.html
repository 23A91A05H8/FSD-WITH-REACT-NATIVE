    <p class="para2">1. Early Life and Background:   Mother Teresa was born as Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, which is now part of North Macedonia. Raised in a devout Albanian Catholic family, she was deeply influenced by her mother’s compassion and faith. From a young age, she felt a strong calling to religious life, and by the age of 18, she left home to join the Sisters of Loreto in Ireland, never to see her family again. Her spiritual dedication and determination to serve others were evident even during her early years.</p>
     <p class="para3">2. Missionary Work in India: After joining the Sisters of Loreto, she was sent to India, where she taught at St. Mary’s High School in Kolkata (then Calcutta). She lived a comfortable life as a teacher, but witnessing the extreme poverty and suffering outside the school walls deeply moved her. In 1946, she experienced what she called “a call within a call” — a divine message urging her to leave the convent and serve the poorest of the poor. Two years later, she received permission to do so and began her work in the slums of Kolkata.</p>
      <p class="para4">3. Founding the Missionaries of Charity: In 1950, Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic religious congregation dedicated to helping “the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted.” The organization grew rapidly and opened hospices, orphanages, and leper houses across India and later in many parts of the world. By the time of her death, the Missionaries of Charity had over 4,000 sisters and was operating in more than 100 countries.</p>
       <p class="para5">4. Her Quotes and Wisdom: Mother Teresa was not only known for her actions but also for her inspiring words. Some of her most famous quotes include:

"Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love."

"If you judge people, you have no time to love them."

"Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier."

"Peace begins with a smile."
Her simple yet profound messages of love, humility, and service continue to resonate with people around the world.</p>
        <p class="para6">Death and Legacy: Mother Teresa passed away on September 5, 1997, at the age of 87. She left behind a legacy of compassion, service, and unwavering faith. In 2016, she was canonized as Saint Teresa of Calcutta by Pope Francis. Her life continues to inspire millions around the globe to serve humanity with love and selflessness. Her legacy lives on through the Missionaries of Charity, which continues her work among the poor and suffering.</p>

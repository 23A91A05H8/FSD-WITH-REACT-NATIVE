     <p>The word ‘Father’ carries immeasurable<br/> importance and worth within a family. We call Mahatma Gandhi the father of the nation and Jawahar Lal Nehru the father of modern India because of their pre-eminent work for the people of the country which was linked to an extraordinary cause and everything was based on honor.

In its simplest sense, a father is the male parent<br/> of a child, the one who leads and guides the family, bringing it into existence. However, in a deeper sense, a father is the one who anticipates the needs of the time and shapes the family by shouldering responsibilities and fulfilling duties. His children consistently show respect for him due to his significant deeds and care toward them.

Even if a father is financially<br/> disadvantaged, he ensures the genuine needs of his children are met, ensuring they do not feel inadequate. These devoted fathers do not hesitate to work tirelessly to increase their earnings for the sake of their children. They willingly make sacrifices and prioritize their children’s well-being.</p>
